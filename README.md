My name is Christopher I'm origionally from Alabama, finished my degree in houston, and now im off the coast of FL. 
My degree is in Game Programming and I focus on VR. I've competed in almost every large game jam for the last 5 years. 

I have a diverse background of skills from complete classic car restoration and electric scooter designs to building a 2D game engine for arduinos. 
Currently I live on a yacht that im building into a self sufficent solar vessel (aka water tesla).
